They mention the L√©ontieff method and the development of sectorial coefficients of pollution-per-currency-unit (send a message to Jonathan pour qu‚Äôil me file la r√©f√©rence de la critique de cet aspect des statistiques de Chancel).\nThey remind a key finding of Chancel and Piketty (2015) : carbon inequalities rised within countries and declined across countries."

For that, they advance :\n\nMarket failures, such as monopoly or the impossibility to get carbon-free products.\nMarkup in the prices, that make individual changes impossible due to budget constraints.\nInformation asymmetries (Akerlof, Rothschild‚Ä¶ (p.6))\nPollution from production does not only serve consumption, because decision power in the production process also fives utility to the producer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe third reason seems to be more name dropping than anything else. The mentioned articles underly the presence of information asymmetry, but the text does not explain how the information asymmetry affects the carbon emissions. The fourth point could be interesting for a micro-foundation of the reasoning."

Production-based approaches and methods of shared attribution (pp.7-)\n\nTo answer the shortcomings of the consumption-based approach, an alternative has been the production-based approach, that is centered around the emissions of producing firms.\n\n30-32. The authors propose to go from firm emissions to individuals emissions by focusing on the individuals running the firm.\n\nThe authors then mention the share attribution methods, that focus on dividing emissions across the members of the production chain depending on thei added value (the reference seems to be Lenzen et al., 2007), the rest being attributed to the consumer. An alternative would be to divide emission by economic surplus. Both methods split the emissions between producers and consumers. They mention that the main inconvenient of this approach is that it requires data at an aggregated level, which is excluded for individual investors.\nThey also mention income-based carbon accounting, by linkning emissions of production to the income received by individuals that participate in the production process, either by working or having capital. They mention that to the best of their knowledge, only two studies of this sort exist (among which a pepr of Pottier p.9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis last approach seems very close to what they are doing, except that it does not seem to involve distributions and national accounting."

Therefore, they base themselves on the DINA framework to construct a micro-macro consistent dataset for income, wealth, and emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMy main concern here is that the usual critiques of the DINA framework could invalidate the data constructed on the DINA framework.\nAlso, what do they exactly mean with micro-macro founded in this context ? Does it refer to the exclusivity criterium of the accounting system, defined in the 19 paragraph ? This confusion should be cleared."
