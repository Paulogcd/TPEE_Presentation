Production-based approaches and methods of shared attribution (pp.7-9)\nTo answer the shortcomings of the consumption-based approach, an alternative has been the production-based approach, that is centered around the emissions of producing firms. The authors propose to go from firm emissions to individuals emissions by focusing on the individuals running the firm. The authors then mention the shared attribution methods, that focus on dividing emissions across the members of the production chain depending on their added value (they make a reference to Lenzen et al., 2007), the rest being attributed to the consumer. An alternative would be to divide emission by economic surplus. Both methods split the emissions between producers and consumers. They mention that the main inconvenient of this approach is that it requires data at an aggregated level, which is excluded for individual investors.\nThey also mention income-based carbon accounting, by linking emissions of production to the income received by individuals that participate in the production process, either by working or having capital. They mention that to the best of their knowledge, only two studies of this sort exist (among which a paper of Pottier p.9)."

    "section": "3.1. Conceptual framework : Three Carbon Footprint Approaches (pp.10-15)",
    "text": "3.1. Conceptual framework : Three Carbon Footprint Approaches (pp.10-15)\nThey develop 3 approches :\n\nownership-based\nconsumption-based\nmixed-based\n\nThey refer to Appendix I, section C1 for a more detailed definition of each approach.\n\nOwnership-based approach\nIn this approach, they attribute all scope 1 emissions (i.e. all direct emissions) to the owners of the firm. Owning a firm can be done through holding corporate equity (in proportion with the share held among the total capital). Owning a firm can also be done directly, for example for self entrepreneurs.\nThis simple rule allows to “overcome” difficulties from the linkage of a stock (wealth) with flow (emissions). They link emissions to production, to capital, to owner, that can be institutional agents, i.e. households, government, corporations, or abroad agents. They only take direct emissions to comply with the exclusivity criterium. Also, they only take into account money that gives ownership-rights, and not purely financial assets. Direct households emissions are simply linked to the households in this method.\nWhen emissions are due to capital owned by the government, they still attribute them to individuals. In their benchmark, all emissions that are related to the health and education sectors are uniformly attributed to all citizen, and emissions from all other sectors are attributed proportionally to the income. hey later relax this approach. If a firm is operating abroad, but the owner is from the country of interest, the emissions are linked to him in this ownership-based approach.\nThe authors then compare their approach with the GHG and PCAF protocol. They identify two main differences :\n\nFirst, the other initiatives attribute emissions to purely financial assets, in opposition to their approach.\nSecond, the other initiatives are not individual and exclusive. All emissions (direct and indirect) are attributed to one asset, and not one individual.\n\nStill comparing the GHG and PCAF to their approaches, the owerniship approach has the closest results to them.\n\n\nMixed-based approach\nIn their mixed-based approach, the authors attribute capital formation emissions to investors (or owners) and the rest of emissions to consumers. They use this difference between money to produce and money invested to reproduce capital of the firms, partially because this differenciation is available in the national accounts. Also, while money to produce production is “demanded” by consumers, money invested is “demanded” by the firm. The authors mention that they use a multi-regional input-output model, in which they separate :\n\ngross fixed capital formation emissions\nfinal households emisions\ngovernment consumption emissions\n\n\nIn this approach, more is attributed to the final consumers than in the previous approach. Also, for the government emissions, they use the same strategy as in the ownership approach.\nThe authors make the distinction between net and gross capital formation. In the gross capital formation is included the replacement of machines, and the buying of new machines (the net capital formation). In other words, gross capital formation investment is the addition of the replacement and investment. The authors decide to attribute gross capital formation because only taking net would attribute the difference to the final consumers. Also, net and gross capital formation have different intensities, so this distinction is important for the results.\n\n54-55. THe authors recall the existence of the value-added approach and of the income-based approach. THeir point is :\n\nThe value-added approach is too difficult to implement if we do not have an aggregate vision of data.\nThe income-based approach is sensitive to manipulation from the firm. It would be beneficial for the firm to for example delay profit flow, making the workers responsible for all its emissions instead of the owners.\n\n\n\nConsumption-based approach\n\nTo see strengths and weaknesses of this approach, check paragraphs (21-28).\nThe authors warn that the ownership appraoch (1) and the consumption and mixed-based approaches (2) have different total emissions. Indeed, some are owners of foreign firms, and some consume from foreign firms.\nTHe authors advance that those approaches are complementary to each other and do a paralel with studying social inequalities. one must not only study the differences in consumption, but also in income and wealth to understand these inequalities."

    "text": "3.2. Data sources (pp.15-18)\n\nWealth data\n\nFor France and Germany, the authors take the Household Finance and COnsumption Survey (HFCS), which has the wealth distribution and the asset owned along this distribution. For the US, they use the Distributional National Accounts (DINA) data (Piketty et al., 2018). Those are micro-files that include tax, survey, and national accounts data.\nThe authors mention that there exist a lot of problems with HFCS data, for example they do not take into account the wealth of the richest part of the distribution. In this sense, they do proceed to correction of the HFCS data.\nThe corrections are essentially a re-weighting approach based on the distribution of the World Inequalitye Database (WID). They fix weights so that they get the same distribution as in the WID. They assume however that the HFCS has correct information about the holding of assets along the wealth distribution. They add that the DINA files do not require corrections.\n\n\n\nMacroeconomic capital stock and balance sheet data\n\nTo get these data, they link emissions to industries, and then to institutional sectors (households, government, corporations, and foreign firms). To do so, they take data from Eurostat for France and Germany. For the USA, they take data from the OECD. For the three countries, they use :\n\n\nStock of fixed assets by industry and year.\nStock of fixed assets by institutional sector.\nStock of financial liabilities by institutional sector and year.\n\n\n\nEmissions data\n\nFot data on emissions, the authors use EUrostat for France and Germany, and the OECD for the USA. They only take the total of scope 1 emissions for all industries.\nThey also want to associate households electricity consumption carbon footprint to the households directly, and not transfer it to the owners of energy producer firms for example. In order to do so, they use extra data :\n\n\nFor Germany, they use the national environmental economic accounts,\nFor France, they use the National Energy Balance,\nFor the USA, they use the monthly energy review tables.\n\n\nIn 64, there are only direct emissions. However, the authors are also interested by indirect emissions, “necessary to satisfy final demande” (p.17). To do so, they use a dataset from the FIGARO (Full International and Global Accounts for Research in input-Output). This dataset is based on input-output tables of industries and compute the “carbon footprint linked to final demand categories”, i.e. among households, the government, gross fixed capital formation (the dataset includes 45 countries plus a category “the rest of the world”). Since the dataset only accounts for dioxyde carbon, and not for other GHG emissions, they rescale emissions to estimate other GHG emissions also.\n\n\n\nEmission inequality data from the literature\n\nTo take the distribution of direct households emissions and consumption-based emissions, they use the following work :\n\n\nFor France, Malliet 2020,\nFor Germany, Hardadi et al., 2021,\nFOr the USA, Starr et al., 2023a.\n\nThey refer to the appendix for more details on those papers.\n\n\nCross-border investment data\n\nFor the emission intensity of cross border investment, they use the following datasets :\n\n\nEU-Finflows for financial investment,\nEU-EDGAR for emission intensity."

For these, one need emissions from capital. Here, I note that “macroeconomic environmental accounts” is just a fnacy name for linkage from emissions to institutional sectors.\n\n\n3.3.1 Step 1 : Extended aggregate environmental and economic accounts (pp.18-23)\n\nThe difference between the usual and extended accounts is that :\n\n\nin the usual accounts, emissions are linked to industries,\nin the extended accounts, emissions are linked to institutional sectors.\n\n\nThe novelty is thus the attribution to the institutional sectors. They also mention that they distringuish the type of capital for the industry.\nThe authors say that they first do the accounts for the ownership-based approach, then for the mix-based approach. Two different versions of the accounts are thus necessary.\n\n73-82. Basically, the do as in Figure 2, page 21 :\n\n\n\nAttribution of emissions to economic sectors in the ownership-based approach\n\n\n\nThey dedicate a specific paragraph to finding proxy for emissions linked to foreign investment, that they get through the EU-Finflow and EU-EDGAR datasets.\n\nThe results of this first step are to be seen in the Figure 3, page 23 :\n\n\n\nTotal national emissions in million tonnes according to the three approaches\n\n\nWe note here that those are national emissions, i.e. aggregated between households, the government, and corporate groups.\n\n\n3.3.2 Step 2 : Distributional environmental accounts (pp.23-26)\n84-85. For capital emissions, they use wealth distribution and the distribution of assets along this wealth distribution (4 different types) to link emissions to individuals. They mention again that some problems exist with the HFCS data. The 4 different types of assets are :\n\nhousing,\ndirectly owned business assts,\npension and life insurance assets,\nequity\n\n86-87 . For consumption-based emissions, they use estimate from Malliet, Hardadi, and Starr, as mentioned in 67.\n\nThey use a generalized Pareto interpolation method to deal with the lack of data points from the papers. For the HFCS, they assume constant elasticity at the top of the distribution (p.25) to deal with the problems they already mentioned about this data.\n\n\nDistributing government emissions\n90-92. They present a benchmark (see 45, page 12), a flat version (uniform redistribution), and a version where government emissions are excluded.\nThe results they obtain are to be seen in Figure 4, page 25 :\n\n\n\nTop 10% emission shares depending on allocation method for government emissions"

The inverse is true for the US citizens, i.e. domestic equities of the US held by US citizens are more carbon intensive than foreign equities held by US citizens.\nThe authors try to explain this difference in carbon intensity of equity by giving two explanations. The first involve the intermediation level of equity, and the second is simply that “ultimate ownership of physical assets are comparatively less carbon-intensive in the US than those owned by French and Germans” (p.31)."

Schope and limitations of the data and footprinting approaches (pp.39-44)\n\nThey now talk about the limitations of their approach\nLimitations linked to data sources : They advance that the first weakness is the fact that the data relies on self-reporting, which could lead to important under-reporting for the top of the distribution. They still find similar result in the three countries, which seems to be a good sign.\nThe second main limitation of the data they use is the limited number of asset classes. More generally, they do not have enough data on the portfolio composition of the agents. For example, it may be that the very rich mainly own the less emitting firms. We cannot know just based on the data of the paper. However, errors are limited since only the very rich own equity.\nAlso, such data is simply unavailable in a some countries, making the study of the carbon footprint of assets impossible there.\nThey also mention that air emissions accounts are not of high quality, especially in the US.\nFocusing on the weaknesses of the consumption-based approach, they mention :\n\n\nsampling bias of budget surveys\nthe assumptoion of these studies is that “emissions per dollar spent for a particular consumption categoy (…) are equal across different income or wealth groups”\naggregation from multiple countries could be problematic.\n\n\nFor the mixed-based approach, the limits are coming from both wealth data and from those mentioned in paragraph number 126.\nCarbon footprints and individual responsibility\n\nA difficulty is that “no broadly defined individual footprinting appraoch can fully capture the actual responsibility individuals bear for emissions” (p.41). Associating emissions with responsibility usually assumes :\n\nagency, intentionaly, and control,\ninformation,\nalternatives\n\n\nIn reality, those 3 conditions are rarely fulfilled.\nFor example, knowledge about emissions associated with certain products is rare. Even when possessed, no alternatives may exist. They give here the example of the Yellow Vests in France between 2018 and 2019.\nOne approach that could meet the 3 conditions of 128 is the ownership-based approach, but even there, some limits exist.\nFor example, who has decision in the firm : managers, or owners ? Even there, the data does not allow for a well defined identification strategy.\nAlso, what if some expenditure are done to reduce carbon footprint in the the future ? For example : eletric vehicules, or machines to diminish the carbon emission of the production process. This add a new form of temporal complexity.\nThe authors estimate that these considerations are unlikely to impact their results.\nThe authors mention that one could model further :\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) the rate of control over indirect emissions.\n\\(\\beta\\) the rate of control over direct emissions.\n\nThe chosen approach could vary in function of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).\n\nMore studies to find out more about \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) would be necessary, to allow for a better definition of the chosen approach.\nThe authors also mention that the role of the government is underestimated here, and that one could study the role of policy making in the process of government emission distribution (they mention the example of the lack of public transportation)."

In this sense, double taxation could be wanted to create a higher incentive for carbon emissions reduction (they mention the case of foreign firms producing for foreign markets, but owned by resident investors). They recall however that this is not the goal of their paper."

An alternative would be to divide emission by economic surplus. Both methods split the emissions between producers and consumers. They mention that the main inconvenient of this approach is that it requires data at an aggregated level, which is excluded for individual investors.\nThey also mention income-based carbon accounting, by linkning emissions of production to the income received by individuals that participate in the production process, either by working or having capital.

Conceptual framework : Three Carbon Footprint Approaches (pp.10-15)\n\nTHey develop 3 approahces :\n\n\nownership-based\nconsumption-based\nmixed-based\n\nThey refer to Appendix I, section C1 for a more detailed definition of each approach.\n\nOwnership-based approach\n\nIn this approach, theyattribute all scope 1 emissions (i.e. all direct emissions) to the owners of the firm. Owning a firm can be done through holding corporate equity (in proportion with the share held among the total capital). Owning a firm can also be done directly, for example for self entrepreneur.\nThis simple rule allows to “overcome” difficulties from the linkage of a stock (wealth) with flow (emissions). They link emissions to production, to cpital, to owner, that can be households, government, corporations, or abroad agents.\nThey only take direct emissions to comply with the exclusivity criterium. Also, they only take into account money that gives ownership-rights, and not purely financial assets.\nDIrect households emissions are simply linked to the households in this method.\nWhen emissions are due to capital owned by the government, they still attribute them to individuals. All emissions that are related to the health and education sectors are uniformly attributed to all citizen, and emissions from all other sectors are attributed proportionally to the income.\nIf a firm is operating abroad, but the owner is from the country of interest, the emissions are linked to him in this ownership-based approach.\nThe authors then compare their approach with the GHG and PCAF protocol. THey identify two main differences :\n\n\nFirst, the other initiatives attribute emissions to purely financial assets, in opposition to their approach.\nSecond, the other initiatives are not individual and exclusive. All emissions (direct and indirect) are attributed to one asset, and not one individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nI am not sure about the PCAF, but the GHG protocol differenciates scope 1,2 and 3. In this sense, one could choose to select the scope 1 emissions only. I don’t see how the GHG would not be exclusive then.\n\n\n\nStill comparing the GHG and PCAF to their approaches, the owerniship approach has the closest results to them.\n\n\n\nMixed-based approach\n\nIn their mixed-based approach, the authors attribute capital formation emissions to investors (or owners) and the rest of emissions to consumers.\nThey use this difference between money to produce and money invested to reproduce capital of the firms, partially because this differenciation is available in the national accounts. Also, while money to produce production is “demanded” by consumers, money invested is “demanded” by the firm.\nThe authors mention that they use a multi-regional input-output model, in which they separate :\n\n\ngross fixed capital formation emissions\nfinal households emisions\ngovernment consumption emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhat is a “multi-refional input-output model” ?\n\n\n\nIn this approach, more is attributed to the final consumers than in the previous approach. Also, for the government emissions, they use the same strategy as in the ownership approach.\nThe authors make the distinction between net and gross capital formation. In the gross capital formation is included the replacement of machines, and the buying of new machines (the net capital formation). In other words, gross capital formation investment is the addition of the replacement and investment. The authors decide to attribute gross capital formation because only taking net would attribute the difference to the final consumers. Also, net and gross capital formation have different intensities, so this distinction is important for the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nI am missing something in the paragraph 53.\n\n\n54-55. THe authors recall the existence of the value-added approach and of the income-based approach. THeir point is :\n\nThe value-added approach is too difficult to implement if we do not have an aggregate vision of data.\nThe income-based approach is sensitive to manipulation from the firm. It would be beneficial for the firm to for example delay profit flow, making the workers responsible for all its emissions instead of the owners.\n\n\n\nConsumption-based approach\n\nTo see strengths and weaknesses of this approach, check paragraphs (21-28).\nThe authors warn that the ownership appraoch (1) and the consumption and mixed-based approaches (2) have different total emissions. Indeed, some are owners of foreign firms, and some consume from foreign firms.\nTHe authors advance that those approaches are complementary to each other and do a paralel with studying social inequalities. one must not only study the differences in consumption, but also in income and wealth to understand these inequalities."

Data sources (pp.15-18)\n\nWealth data\n\nFor France and Germany, the authors take the Household Finance and COnsumption Survey (HFCS), which has the wealth distribution and the asset owned along this distribution. For the US, they use the Distributional National Accounts (DINA) data (Piketty et al., 2018). Those are micro-files that include tax, survey, and national accounts data.\nThe authors mention that there exist a lot of problems with HFCS data, for example they do not take into account the wealth of the richest part of the distribution. In this sense, they do proceed to correction of the HFCS data.\nThe corrections are essentially a re-weighting approach based on the distribution of the World Inequalitye Database (WID). They fix weights so that they get the same distribution as in the WID. They assume however that the HFCS has correct information about the holding of assets along the wealth distribution. They add that the DINA files do not require corrections.\n\n\n\nMacroeconomic capital stock and balance sheet data\n\nTo get these data, they link emissions to industries, and then to institutional sectors (households, government, corporations, and foreign firms). To do so, they take data from Eurostat for France and Germany. For the USA, they take data from the OECD. For the three countries, they use :\n\n\nStock of fixed assets by industry and year.\nStock of fixed assets by institutional sector.\nStock of financial liabilities by institutional sector and year.\n\n\n\nEmissions data\n\nFot data on emissions, the authors use EUrostat for France and Germany, and the OECD for the USA. They only take the total of scope 1 emissions for all industries.\nThey also want to associate households electricity consumption carbon footprint to the households directly, and not transfer it to the owners of energy producer firms for example. In order to do so, they use extra data :\n\n\nFor Germany, they use the national environmental economic accounts,\nFor France, they use the National Energy Balance,\nFor the USA, they use the monthly energy review tables.\n\n\nIn 64, there are only direct emissions. However, the authors are also interested by indirect emissions, “necessary to satisfy final demande” (p.17). To do so, they use a dataset from the FIGARO (Full International and Global Accounts for Research in input-Output). This dataset is based on input-output tables of industries and compute the “carbon footprint linked to final demand categories”, i.e. among households, the government, gross fixed capital formation (the dataset includes 45 countries plus a category “the rest of the world”). Since the dataset only accounts for dioxyde carbon, and not for other GHG emissions, they rescale emissions to estimate other GHG emissions also.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThey refer to appendix I, B.10 for more details on this point.\nI think it is important to be able to present the methodology of 64 in detail, and to know how to explain what an inpu-output table is. Check page 17.\n\n\n\n\nEmission inequality data from the literature\n\nTo take the distribution of direct households emissions and consumption-based emissions, they use the following work :\n\n\nFor France, Malliet 2020,\nFor Germany, Hardadi et al., 2021,\nFOr the USA, Starr et al., 2023a.\n\nThey refer to the appendix for more details on those papers.\n\n\nCross-border investment data\n\nFor the emission intensity of cross border investment, they use the following datasets :\n\n\nEU-Finflows for financial investment,\nEU-EDGAR for emission intensity."

The 4 different types of assets are :\n\nhousing,\ndirectly owned business assts,\npension and life insurance assets,\nequity\n\n86-87 .

    "text": "6.2. Schope and limitations of the data and footprinting approaches (pp.39-44)\n\nThey now talk about the limitations of their approach\nLimitations linked to data sources : They advance that the first weakness is the fact that the data relies on self-reporting, which could lead to important under-reporting for the top of the distribution. They still find similar result in the three countries, which seems to be a good sign.\nThe second main limitation of the data they use is the limited number of asset classes. More generally, they do not have enough data on the portfolio composition of the agents. For example, it may be that the very rich mainly own the less emitting firms. We cannot know just based on the data of the paper. However, errors are limited since only the very rich own equity.\nAlso, such data is simply unavailable in a some countries, making the study of the carbon footprint of assets impossible there.\nThey also mention that air emissions accounts are not of high quality, especially in the US.\nFocusing on the weaknesses of the consumption-based approach, they mention :\n\n\nsampling bias of budget surveys\nthe assumptoion of these studies is that “emissions per dollar spent for a particular consumption categoy (…) are equal across different income or wealth groups”\naggregation from multiple countries could be problematic.\n\n\nFor the mixed-based approach, the limits are coming from both wealth data and from those mentioned in paragraph number 126.\nCarbon footprints and individual responsibility\n\nA difficulty is that “no broadly defined individual footprinting appraoch can fully capture the actual responsibility individuals bear for emissions” (p.41). Associating emissions with responsibility usually assumes :\n\nagency, intentionaly, and control,\ninformation,\nalternatives\n\n\nIn reality, those 3 conditions are rarely fulfilled.\nFor example, knowledge about emissions associated with certain products is rare. Even when possessed, no alternatives may exist. They give here the example of the Yellow Vests in France between 2018 and 2019.\nOne approach that could meet the 3 conditions of 128 is the ownership-based approach, but even there, some limits exist.\nFor example, who has decision in the firm : managers, or owners ? Even there, the data does not allow for a well defined identification strategy.\nAlso, what if some expenditure are done to reduce carbon footprint in the the future ? For example : eletric vehicules, or machines to diminish the carbon emission of the production process. This add a new form of temporal complexity.\nThe authors estimate that these considerations are unlikely to impact their results.\nThe authors mention that one could model further :\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) the rate of control over indirect emissions.\n\\(\\beta\\) the rate of control over direct emissions.\n\nThe chosen approach could vary in function of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).\n\nMore studies to find out more about \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) would be necessary, to allow for a better definition of the chosen approach.\nThe authors also mention that the role of the government is underestimated here, and that one could study the role of policy making in the process of government emission distribution (they mention the example of the lack of public transportation)."

They here mention the “Environmental Kuznets Curve”, and say that their study goes against it.\nIn the consumption-based approach, carbon intensity may be higher for the poorest, because less intensive products are costlier, but carbon emissions are still higher.\nTHe opposite is tru for wealth emissions, which are more concentrated than wealth itself. Indeed, carbon intensity is very high for the top of the distribution…"

Taxation on consumption and goods are propblematic, because of the focus on consumption…\n\nThey mention figure 9 (p.49), that presents the progressivity of a 150 euro/dollar per tonne on different types of emissions.

Their goal with the precedent figures is not to argue that those are taxation policy that should be implemented, but more to show that alternatives are possible in the implementation of policies to go against CO2 emissions : “Departing from a purely Pigouvian perspective, carbon taxes could also be rationalized as a policy tool to achieve an externally defined behavioral change with the most limited harm to social welfare” (p.48).\nThey then answer concerns about possible double-taxation by putting the emphasis on the need for a reflexion on taxation strategy. In this sense, double taxation could be wanted to create a higher incentive for carbon emissions reduction (they mention the case of foreign firms producing for foreign markets, but owned by resident investors). They recall however that this is not the goal of their paper."
