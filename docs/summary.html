<p>This is a working summary of the paper</p>
<section id="abstract-p.0" class="level1">
<h1>Abstract (p.0)</h1>
<p>The Abstract of the paper gives general indications about where the paper wants to go :</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the carbon footprint of capital ? What is its distribution ?</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer this question, they offer a new acounting framework that captures all emissions without double counting.</p>
<p>Their results are :</p>
<ul>
<li>This accounting framework underlies that the rich parts of the distributions are much more responsible of the emissions than in other accounting systems.</li>
<li>For the very rich, most of their emissions stem from asset ownership, not from direct energy consumption.</li>
<li>Emissions from capital ownership is more concentrated than cpital itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>The implications at the policy-level are that targeting individual assets and investments should be promising to reduce CO_2 emissions.</p>

<section id="introduction-pp.1-4" class="level1">
<h1>1 Introduction (pp.1-4)</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>They identify an existing gap in the literature of carbon accounting : individuals as owners of polluting assets. Indeed, they underly that most of the existing literature focus on either the country level, or on the individual as final consumers, or finally on the corporate as producers.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of the literature of carbon accounting focused on individuals have taken the consumer based approach. At the international level, this is interesting because it allows a study of why some countries have emissions that in fact are due to the living standard level of other countries. At the national level however, this is problematic because there is a clear problem in putting all the responsibility of the carbon emissions to the final consumer.</p></li>
<li><p>They say that this article has 3 main goals :</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Define 3 measures of individual carbon footprint including ownership-related emissions.</li>
<li>Apply those measure to France, Germany, and the USA.</li>
<li>Show stylized facts and discuss implications at the environmental and tax policies level.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The 3 approaches of measure of individual carbon footprint are :</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>owenrship-based approach : emissions from production are attributed to firm owners.</li>
<li>consumption-based approach : attribution to the final consumers.</li>
<li>mixed-based approach : emissions from production are attributed to consumers, except the ones du to capital formation (investment).</li>
</ul>
<p>They say that in all approaches, direct emissions of Households are attributed to the Households themselves.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>They combining official environmental accounts (i.e.&nbsp;air emissions) and national accounts (like production, income, and wealth) to compute the carbon distribution at the individual level for the 3 approaches.</p></li>
<li><p>With the distribution of asset ownership, they estimate the individual emissions of asset ownership, with “existing estimates from the literature on the distribution of direct and consumption-based emissions”(p.2). Essentially, they combine :</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>estimates of emissions</li>
<li>asset ownership distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>To estimate individual emissions of asset ownership.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><p>Using this approach, they find important emissions inequalities. When using the ownership-based approach, the rich are much more responsible of emissions (increase by 2 to 2.8 timefolds).</p></li>
<li><p>Also, they find that the majority of emissions of the wealthiest come from their asset, and not from their consumption.</p></li>
<li><p>They also note a higher concentration of emissions from wealth ownership. In other words, the assets of the very rich have a higher emission intensity in average.</p></li>
<li><p>They conclude that a tax on wealth emissions would be more progressive than a tax on emissions of consumption.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Contributions to the literature :</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li><p>They claim that their accounting system is consistent with satellite environmental accounts and distributional national accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, they depart from the consumption-based literature and offer a framework for individuals such as owners and investors.</p></li>
<li><p>THey claim to provide original data about emissions of types of assets, that are consistent with macroeconomics totals.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Market failures, such as monopoly or the impossibility to get carbon-free products.</li>
<li>Markup in the prices, that make individual changes impossible due to budget constraints.</li>

<li>To answer the shortcomings of the consumption-based approach, an alternative has been the production-based approach, that is centered around the emissions of producing firms.</li>
</ol>
<p>30-32. The authors propose to go from firm emissions to individuals emissions by focusing on the individuals running the firm.</p>
<ol start="33" type="1">
<li><p>The authors then mention the share attribution methods, that focus on dividing emissions across the members of the production chain depending on thei added value (the reference seems to be Lenzen et al., 2007), the rest being attributed to the consumer. An alternative would be to divide emission by economic surplus. Both methods split the emissions between producers and consumers. They mention that the main inconvenient of this approach is that it requires data at an aggregated level, which is excluded for individual investors.</p></li>
<li><p>They also mention income-based carbon accounting, by linkning emissions of production to the income received by individuals that participate in the production process, either by working or having capital. They mention that to the best of their knowledge, only two studies of this sort exist (among which a pepr of Pottier p.9).</p></li>

<li><p>In this approach, theyattribute all scope 1 emissions (i.e.&nbsp;all direct emissions) to the owners of the firm. Owning a firm can be done through holding corporate equity (in proportion with the share held among the total capital). Owning a firm can also be done directly, for example for self entrepreneur.</p></li>
<li><p>This simple rule allows to “overcome” difficulties from the linkage of a stock (wealth) with flow (emissions). They link emissions to production, to cpital, to owner, that can be households, government, corporations, or abroad agents.</p></li>
<li><p>They only take direct emissions to comply with the exclusivity criterium. Also, they only take into account money that gives ownership-rights, and not purely financial assets.</p></li>
<li><p>DIrect households emissions are simply linked to the households in this method.</p></li>
<li><p>When emissions are due to capital owned by the government, they still attribute them to individuals. All emissions that are related to the health and education sectors are uniformly attributed to all citizen, and emissions from all other sectors are attributed proportionally to the income.</p></li>
<li><p>If a firm is operating abroad, but the owner is from the country of interest, the emissions are linked to him in this ownership-based approach.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors then compare their approach with the GHG and PCAF protocol. THey identify two main differences :</p></li>

In the meanwhile, the top 10% of France own 5% more of the national wealth than the top 10% of Germany.</p></li>
<li><p>Comparing the top 10% of the US to France and Germany, they get that the US group emits 3 times more than the french group, and twice the amount of the german group.</p></li>

<ol start="121" type="1">
<li><p>They now talk about the limitations of their approach</p></li>
<li><p>Limitations linked to data sources : They advance that the first weakness is the fact that the data relies on self-reporting, which could lead to important under-reporting for the top of the distribution. They still find similar result in the three countries, which seems to be a good sign.</p></li>
<li><p>The second main limitation of the data they use is the limited number of asset classes. More generally, they do not have enough data on the portfolio composition of the agents. For example, it may be that the very rich mainly own the less emitting firms. We cannot know just based on the data of the paper. However, errors are limited since only the very rich own equity.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, such data is simply unavailable in a some countries, making the study of the carbon footprint of assets impossible there.</p></li>
<li><p>They also mention that air emissions accounts are not of high quality, especially in the US.</p></li>
<li><p>Focusing on the weaknesses of the consumption-based approach, they mention :</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>sampling bias of budget surveys</li>
<li>the assumptoion of these studies is that “emissions per dollar spent for a particular consumption categoy (…) are equal across different income or wealth groups”</li>
<li>aggregation from multiple countries could be problematic.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="127" type="1">
<li><p>For the mixed-based approach, the limits are coming from both wealth data and from those mentioned in paragraph number 126.</p></li>
<li><p>Carbon footprints and individual responsibility</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A difficulty is that “no broadly defined individual footprinting appraoch can fully capture the actual responsibility individuals bear for emissions” (p.41). Associating emissions with responsibility usually assumes :</p>
<ul>
<li>agency, intentionaly, and control,</li>
<li>information,</li>
<li>alternatives</li>
</ul>
<ol start="129" type="1">
<li><p>In reality, those 3 conditions are rarely fulfilled.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, knowledge about emissions associated with certain products is rare. Even when possessed, no alternatives may exist. They give here the example of the Yellow Vests in France between 2018 and 2019.</p></li>
<li><p>One approach that could meet the 3 conditions of 128 is the ownership-based approach, but even there, some limits exist.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, who has decision in the firm : managers, or owners ? Even there, the data does not allow for a well defined identification strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, what if some expenditure are done to reduce carbon footprint in the the future ? For example : eletric vehicules, or machines to diminish the carbon emission of the production process. This add a new form of temporal complexity.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors estimate that these considerations are unlikely to impact their results.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors mention that one could model further :</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> the rate of control over indirect emissions.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> the rate of control over direct emissions.</li>
